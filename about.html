                After 21 years of fruitful existence with Pines City National High School, 
                Magsaysay Annex is now an independent national high school. MNHS was a joint 
                venture of the late couple Dr. Philip M. Flores, then the Principal of PCNHS, 
                and Nelda Flores, then Barangay Captain of New Lucban. They were supported by 
                the New Lucban Sto. Ni√±o Barangay Councils and the City Government of Baguio, 
                thus City Resolution No. 186-68 was created in June 13, 1988. The miracles of 
                sharing made the miracles during the first years of MNHS. It started with 53 
                students in school year 1989-1990 with Mr. Eduardo C. Palaroan and Mrs. Estelita 
                F. Valdez as pioneer teachers. Magsaysay Elementary School lent one classroom, 
                including physical facility resources. New Lucban barangay council gave 55 arm chairs,
                 set of teachers' table and chair. Likewise, the mother school produced textbooks for 
                 students' use. Other school needs were also met due to parents' and community's support
                  and donations. Enrollment dramatically increased the following school years, thus 
                  additional teachers started to come. Moreover, students consistently gave honor to 
                  the school by reaping awards in various competitions. In fact the valedictorian and 
                  salutatorian of the 1st Commencement Exercises among all six campuses of PCNHS came 
                  from Magnex: Angeline Bogalin and Ralph Altiyen respectively. Both were first graduate 
                  of the school. At present, the school has 36 committed teachers who do not only toil 
                  with their hands but work with their hearts in realizing the school's mission and vision.
